    "Matplotlib is a multiplatform data visualization library for Python, originally created in 2003 as a patch for IPython for enabling interactive MATLAB-style plotting from the IPython command line [2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is built on NumPy arrays and designed to work with SciPy stack [2]. Its design philosophy is that it should be possible to create simple plots with just a few commands [1] but at the same time it allows for high degree of customization of parameters of created plots (colours, markers, line style etc, to name just few).\n",
    "\n",
    "One of its strengths is compatibility with many different operating systems and graphics backends, ensuring correct operation regardless the users platform. This has led to wide adoption of this package by the large userbase which in turn led to large active developer base and the package popularity [2].\n",
    "\n",
    "After being in use for nearly two decades, the interface and style of Matplotlib is showing it's age. It also predates Pandas for over a decade, so it's not designed to be used with Pandas ```DataFrames```. The answer to these weaknesses of Matplotlib is a Seaborn package. It provides a high-level interface on top of Matplotlib and offers large choices for plot styles and customization and defines high-level functions for common statistical plot types [2]. However, because Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib, full customization of its plots require some knowledge of Matplotlib's concepts and interface [3]. Therefore, it's a good idea to learn how to use Matplotlib first before adopting Seaborn."

The main difference is, that using object-oriented interface, ```plot()``` and ```set_xlabel(), set_ylabel()``` functions are called explicitly on the instance of the Axes object and the ```legend()``` function is explicitly called on the instance of Figure object. In the state-based interface, these functions are called from the ```plt``` interface which executes these functions on the active Figure or Axes instances which are obscured from the user. What's more, since we have an explicit access to the Axes instance ```spines['top'].set_visible(False)``` function can be called  directly on this instance and there is no need to call ```plt.gca()``` function to get the current active instance of Axes object like in the state based interface.
